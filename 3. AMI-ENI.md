# 1. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card 
The ENI can have the following attributes:
  *  Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
  * One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
  * One Public IPv4
  * One or more security groups
  * A MAC address  

You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover they are bound to a specific availability zone (AZ)  
![ENI](/images/ENI.png "ENI")
* for example we are going to create 2 instance from same properties
* when we check their network interfaces is same
* here we can create a Custom network interface and we can change that ENI between instances 
* instances can have more than one ENI
* The important thing when you create ENI you need to choose right AZ.

# 2. AMI
## What’s an AMI?
AWS comes with base images such as Ubuntu, Fedora .... But what if we could create our own image, ready to go?
That’s an AMI – an image to use to create our instances. AMIs can be built for Linux or Windows machines
## Why would you use a custom AMI ?
Using a custom built AMI can provide the following advantages
* Pre-installed packages needed
* Faster boot time (no need for long ec2 user data at boot time)
* Machine comes configured with monitoring / enterprise software
* Security concerns – control over the machines in the network
* Control of maintenance and updates of AMIs over time
* Active Directory Integration out of the box
* Installing your app ahead of time (for faster deploys when auto-scaling)
* Using someone else’s AMI that is optimised for running an app, DB, etc…

AMI are built for a specific AWS region (!)
## EC2 Instances Overview
Instances have 5 distinct characteristics advertised on the website
* The RAM (type, amount, generation)
* The CPU (type, make, frequency, generation, number of cores)
* The I/O (disk performance, EBS optimisations)
* The Network (network bandwidth, network latency)
* The Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)
