# 1. Elastic Load Balancer(ELB)
 EC2 is basicly servers. when you try to lunch a EC2 basicly you are going to create a Virtual Server.
 it mainly sonsist : 
 * Renting Virtual Machines(EC2)
 * Storing data on virtual drives(EBS)
 * Distributes load accross machines(ELB)
 * Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)

1. So we will go to services part and search EC2 after we found we need to choose basic AMI(Amazon Machine images).
so in this example we will choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI.  
2. Then we are going to choose instance type. thats mean we are going to choose how powerfull machine you want. 
3. after next here we are to configure Details
    * Number of instance 1 if you want more it will create more instances from same settings.
    * we havent Custom VPC(Vitual private server) so use default one
    * Subnet, if you want your instances work in specific availibility zone then you can choose one.
    * Auto-assign Public IP will define a public ip for you with that your instance will be open to internet.
    * and you can skip remains will be advanced.
4. then we are going to choose storage, we can leave all choices same and go next
5. the tags is using find your services easily in that case you can give specific label for example:training instance
6. Security Group is behave like a firewall before your instance for example : you dont want to open xxx port to outside. here you change name of group also
7. review part and click Lunch; here you are going to create key pair for access your machine from SSH. dont give your key anybody or deploy public place. download them and Click Launch Instances

## Connect EC2 Instance
### **Mac OS/Linux**
  1. copy your public ip in instnace-detail you will find it. and check from security groups port 22 open.
  2. ssh ec2-user@x.xx.xxx.xx when you run that in the first i will want key from you.
  3. so goto under the folder which one has your key and try to run below command
  4. ssh -i training-instance.pem ec2-user@x.xx.xxx.xx 
  5. in the first time you will get UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE error.
  6. for fixing chmod 0400 training-instance.pem
  7. ssh -i training-instance.pem ec2-user@x.xx.xxx.xx again 
  8. now you are in
### **Windows**  
  1.  after you install putty you need to open puttygen for transform .pem file to .ppk
  2.  after you load just click **save private key** button
  3.  open your putty again
  4.  copy ec2-user@x.xx.xxx.xx to the host part
  5.  save it like :aws-training-instance
  6.  then for referance ppk file goto SSH from left menu then Auth
  7.  in the right side **private key file for authentication**  browse and load ppk
  8.  then click open you will connect successfully
### **Browser**  
   1. instance->actions->connect

# 2. Auto Scaling Groups(ASG)
it is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 user data script. Well, bootstrapping means launching commands when the machine starts.
So, that script is only run once and when it first starts.
when you boot your instance? 
Well you want to install updates, install software, download common files from the internet, or anything you can think of, really.
