# EC2 Storgae EBS-EFS
Ec2 is general name of Storage in AWS
## 1. EBS
### What is EBS Volume
* An EC2 machine loses its root volume (main drive) when it is manually terminated.
* Unexpected terminations might happen from time to time (AWS would email you)
* Sometimes, you need a way to store your instance data somewhere
* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
* It allows your instances to persist data     
### EBS Volume
* It’s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  * It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  * It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
* It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  * An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
  * To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  * You get billed for all the provisioned capacity(if you buy 1tb use 1gb you'll pay for 1tb)
  * You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
### EBS Volume Types
* GP2 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
* IO1 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high- throughput workloads
* ST1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput- intensive workloads
* SC1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
### Hands on
* goot instances and new launc instance when you come to storage part
* you have root volume and you will add new Volume and choose EBS volume
* sign in your device from console type **lsblk**
* then for use EBS in linux type **sudo file -s /dev/xvdb** it will return data thats mean there is not any file system on disk we need to create one
* type **sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb**
* now we need mount data folder type **sudo mkdir /data** then **sudo mount /dev/xvdb /data** 
* now you can go data folder create files
## EBS Volume Types Use cases
* ### GP2 (from AWS doc)
  * Recommended for most workloads 
  * System boot volumes 
  * Virtual desktops 
  * Low-latency interactive apps 
  * Development and test environments
  * 1 GiB - 16 TiB 
  * Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3000 
  * Max IOPS is 16,000… * 3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334GB we are at the max IOPS
  * Hands on 
    * Goto your Elastic blook store and create volume
    * and select GP2
* ### IOI (from AWS doc)
  * Critical business applications that require sustained IOPS performance, or more than 16,000 IOPS per volume (gp2 limit) 
  * Large database workloads, such as:
  * MongoDB, Cassandra, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
  * 4 GiB - 16 TiB
  * IOPS is provisioned (PIOPS) – MIN 100 - MAX 64,000 (Nitro instances) else MAX 32,000 (other instances)
  * The maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size (in GiB) is 50:1
* ### ST1 (from AWS doc)
  * Streaming workloads requiring consistent, fast throughput at a low price.
  * Big data, Data warehouses, Log processing
  * Apache Kafka
  * Cannot be a boot volume
* ### SCI (from AWS doc)
  * Throughput-oriented storage for large volumes of data that is infrequently accessed
  * Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important
  * Cannot be a boot volume
## Local EC2 Instance Store
 * Physical disk attached to the physical server where your EC2 is
 * Very High IOPS (because physical)
 * Block Storage (just like EBS) 
 * Cannot be increased in size 
 * Risk of data loss if hardware fails
 * when you choose instance type you are going to choose instance type which one has storage 
 * and then in the storage step you can do some settings on storage
  
## EBS vs Instance Store
 * Some instance do not come with Root EBS volumes
 * Instead, they come with “Instance Store” (= ephemeral storage)
 * Instance store is physically attached to the machine (EBS is a network drive) 
 * Pros:
    * Better I/O performance (EBS gp2 has an max IOPS of 16000, io1 of 64000)
    * Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
    * Data survives reboots
 * Cons:
    * On stop or termination, the instance store is lost
    * You can’t resize the instance store
    * Backups must be operated by the user
## 2. EFS Elastic File System
* Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
* EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
* Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use
  ![EFS](/images/EFS-FILE-SYSTEM.PNG "EFS") 
* Use cases: content management, web serving, data sharing, Wordpress
* Uses NFSv4.1 protocol
* Uses security group to control access to EFS
* Compatible with Linux based AMI (not Windows)
* Encryption at rest using KMS
* POSIX file system (~Linux) that has a standard file API
* File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning 
### EFS – Performance & Storage Classes
* EFS Scale
  * 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+ /s throughput
  * Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically
* Performance mode (set at EFS creation time)
  * General purpose (default): latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc…)
  * Max I/O – higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
* Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature – move file after N days)
  * Standard: for frequently accessed files
  * Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
### Hands on
* goto services search EFS and go on
* there is also backup choice
* lifecycle management is using if a file is not using for x days(chocing from menu) move it to EFS frequent storage system
* Network Access Settings we can mount different AZ for each AZ we are going to define security gorups
* skip policy
* review and create
* then we are going to create two ec2 to instances with new same security group from different AZ
* for mount efs to EC2 goto your EFS file-systems
* on the top right there is Attach button and there is showing how to mount
* but goto your user guide for more and install small package to EC2 instances
* Installing the amazon-efs-utils package
* Installing the amazon-efs-utils Package on Amazon Linux
* **sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils**
* we are going back to our file-sytem and try to mount it now
* **sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-fabedd82:/ efs**
* **sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-fabedd82.efs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:/ efs**
* before the runs we need to modify security gorups we need to give inbound rule take requests from EFS
* then we can run commands
* then you will see both instances see the efs file system changes in same time
### EBS vs EFS
* EBS volumes…
  * can be attached to only one instance at a time
  * are locked at the Availability Zone (AZ) level
  * gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases
  * io1: can increase IO independently
* To migrate an EBS volume across AZ
  * Take a snapshot
  * Restore the snapshot to another AZ
  * EBS backups use IO and you shouldn’t run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic
* Root EBS Volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated. (you can disable that)
* Mounting 100s of instances across AZ
* EFS share website files (WordPress)
* Only for Linux Instances (POSIX)
* EFS has a higher price point than EBS
* Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings
* Remember: EFS vs EBS vs Instance Store
* Is running a DB on EC2 instance store possible? It is possible to run a database on EC2. It is also possible to use instance store, but there are some considerations to have. The data will be lost if the instance is stopped, but it can be restarted without problems. One can also set up a replication mechanism on another EC2 instance with instance store to have a standby copy. One can also have back-up mechanisms. It's all up to how you want to set up your architecture to validate your requirements. In this case, it's around IOPS, and we build an architecture of replication and back up around
